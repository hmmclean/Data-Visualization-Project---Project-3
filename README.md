# Visualizing America's State Parks
## Exploring America's Natural Wonders: A Comprehensive National Parks Website Project

[View our Website Here!](https://hmmclean.github.io/Data-Visualization-Project_Project-3/WEBSITE/index.html)

# Overview
We started with the idea of building a website to help people determine which of Americaâ€™s national parks to visit. We wanted to show activities, distances, states, directions, and weather. This project aims to create a valuable resource for individuals interested in exploring and learning about the diverse national parks across the United States.

# Repo Navigation 
* Resources
    * Cleaned - CSVs of final cleaned data.
    * Data Sources - JSONs of final cleaned data. These are being hosted on a separate GitHub repo ([Activities](https://github.com/QbicleTKG/activities-data-json-hosting) and [Parks List](https://github.com/QbicleTKG/parks-list-data-json-hosting)).
    * Uncleaned - CSVs of data pulled from the NPS API.
    * NPS_API_Data_Pull - Code used to pull the data from the NPS API.
 * WEBSITE - HTML, JS, and CSS source documentation for our website. 
* Project Rubric - Text file containing the standards for our assignment.
* Data Transformation Jupyter Notebook - main code used for initial data cleaning.
* MongoApp - PyMongo Jupyter Notebook used to provide information on loading cleaned CSVs into MongoDB and JSONifying them.

# Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading

## Extraction 
- We pulled 5 CSVs from the National Park Services API:
   - Activities
   - Fees and Passes
   - Park Activities
   - Parks List
   - Visitors' Centers

## Transform
- After some deliberation as a team and diving into each spreadsheet, we decided to keep only the Activities database and to merge the Fees/Passes and Parks List datasets.

## Load
- Once data cleaning was complete, the data was loaded into MongoDB and JSONified via PyMongo. We chose MongoDB due to the ease with which it can be integrated into Python/Jupyter Notebooks using PyMongo. The JSON files were hosted on separate Github repos to allow easy access to the data for website construction.
### Note! If you are attempting this project yourself given the data here, the two code lines you need to upload the cleaned CSVs are ```mongoimport --type csv -d national_parks -c parks_list --drop --headerline --file parks_list_cleaned.csv```, and ```mongoimport --type csv -d national_parks -c activities --drop --headerline --file activities.csv```.
