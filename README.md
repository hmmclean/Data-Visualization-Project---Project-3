# Visualizing America's State Parks
Exploring America's Natural Wonders: A Comprehensive National Parks Website Project

# Overview
We started with the idea to build a website to help people determine which of Americaâ€™s National Parks to visit. We wanted to show activities, distances, states, directions, and weather. This project aims to create a valuable resource for individuals interested in exploring and learning about the diverse national parks across the United States.

## Extraction 
- From the National Park Services API we pulled 6 CSVs:
   - Activities
   - Fees and Passes
   - Park Activities
   - Parks List
   - Visitors' Centers

## Transformation
- After some deliberation as a team, and diving into each spreadsheet, we decided to only keep the Activities database, and to merge the Fees/Passes and Parks List datasets.
